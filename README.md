# WebSockets & vue

## Testing WebSockets with Vue on the front-end

I'm testing how to set up a WebSocket server in node.js and using Vue to listen for events that are emitted from the 
backend to update the front-end with whatever data is sent.

### How to run locally

- Clone repo to local directory
- Run `npm install` in the **root** directory
- Once this has finished, run `node server/index.js` to start the app
- Go to **http://localhost:8082** in your browser

### Deployment 

I'm deploying this automatically through GitHub commits to master on to Heroku.
